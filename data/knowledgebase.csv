Management,Strategy,What are the five elements of a good business strategy?,Overarching goal + Where to play + How to play + BMS + Strategic core capabilities
Pipeline Engineering,Analysis,Can you have more than one tri-linear soils model in a sequence of Abaqus analyses when assessing ISB (or similar)?,"No, you need to change between Coulomb friction and one tri-linear definition, you can't change between multiple tri-linear definitions (this was the case/limitation in 2024)."
Management,Strategy,What is strategic innovation?,"Strategic innovation refers to innovation targeted at enhancing or transforming strategic core capabilities (i.e., defined in the business strategy)"
Pipeline Engineering,Analysis,"According to DNV-RP-F110 (2021), what are the criteria for complying with requirements for an 'even' or 'moderately unven' seabed? i.e., the context of global buckling.",LCC less than 0.2 (water filled) or 0.3 (under max EAF) prior to buckle initiation. Ramp up analyses until just before buckle occurs. May also need to remove sleepers from the model.
Management,Strategy,Who are the Big 4?,"The Big 4 are the four largest international accounting and professional services firms. They are Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC. Each provides audit, tax, consulting and financial advisory services to major corporations."
Management,Strategy,Who are the Big 3 or MBBs?,"The Big 3 or MBB is the name given to the three largest strategy consulting firms, namely McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Co."
Pipeline Engineering,Welding,Can you re-use qualified welding procedures from another (say previous) contractor?,"Typically, no. DNV ST-F101 states ""A qualified welding procedure of a particular manufacturer is valid for welding only in workshops or sites under the operational technical and quality control of that manufacturer"". Also, the automated welding equipment is an essential variable, hence, any change in make, type and model for partly-mechanised, mechanised and automatic welding results in non-conformance. It is very difficult to achieve same conditions with a new contractor. "
Project Management,Wood BMS,"In internal PM reporting, what is meant by ""Current Revenue Budget""?",Original Sales Value + Any variations that the client has submitted. 
Project Management,Wood BMS,"In internal PM reporting, what is meant by ""Current Cost Budget""? ",As sold position of cost so actual burdened cost to hit the project excluding margin. 
Project Management,Wood BMS,"In internal PM reporting, what is meant by ""Current Project Revenue forecast""? ",Approved value plus any additions you have agreed with the client that are not approved in order yet. 
Project Management,Wood BMS,"In internal PM reporting, what is meant by ""Cost forecast""? ",Corresponding cost without margin. 
Project Management,Wood BMS,"In internal PM reporting, what is meant by ""Actual Rev ITD""? ",Actual revenue incurred to the end of the month reported. so in December its to the end of November. 
Project Management,Wood BMS,"In internal PM reporting, what is meant by ""Cost ITD""? ",Actual cost incurred to date without the margin. 
Project Management,Wood BMS,"In internal PM reporting, what is meant by ""Reporting currency""? ","Functional currency of the Business unit so Galway Euro, UK GBP, even if the order is issued in a different currency. "
Subsea Engineering,Materials,Should Xylan coating be specified for bolts in subsea applications?,"No, because it interferes with the CP system and acts as an isolator, making CP protection (of the bolts) ineffective. Also, the coating can get damaged when torqing up. It is more common in onshore structures/pipelines. It does make bolt tightening easier (less friction). Hence, sometimes preferred by contractors. If specified by a client, it could be a carryover from onshore specifications."
Subsea Engineering,Materials,Are bolts for subsea applications specified with a galvanised finish?,"For nuts and bolts subject to CP, a thick coating of zinc is not required and can cause problems with threads, therefore thinner coatings are specified for corrosion resistance during transit and storage only. "
Subsea Engineering,Valves,For what valve components are Level 3.2 inspection certs typically required?,"The Fabulous 5 elements, i.e., the Body, Bonnet, Stem, Ball and Seats."
Subsea Engineering,Valves,Is it acceptable to accept PR2 testing from previous valves/projects? ,"Generally, you can accept PR2 testing from previous projects, one size up or one size down is OK. Otherwise, perform projct-specific PR2 testing (e.g., HHTP project 2024). A guide price (based on Wood 2022 in-house data) for PR2 valve testing is c.$50,000. HHTP cost in 2024 was $28,187. Typical schedule impact is 4-6 weeks."
Subsea Engineering,Valves,Why would you specify a DPE (double piston effect) seat on one side of a valve?,"SPE/DPE good for blind flange side. DPE offers more protection against leak downstream but is more costly. SPE (single piston effect allows pressure above the design pressure, in the cavity to be relived to the downstream pipe. DPE does not allow this, pressure builds up in cavity. Usually there is a separate means to relieve this pressure from the cavity."
Subsea Engineering,Materials,Can you perform welding qualification if you don't have test rings/materials for the project?,"It's undesirable, but it may be acceptable if the contractor can find suitable materials with similar chemistry to the project materials, e.g., pipe, flanges, etc."
