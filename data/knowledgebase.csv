Pipeline Engineering,Welding,WPQR,Can you re-use qualified welding procedures from another (say previous) contractor?,"Typically, no. DNV ST-F101 states ""A qualified welding procedure of a particular manufacturer is valid for welding only in workshops or sites under the operational technical and quality control of that manufacturer"". Also, the automated welding equipment is an essential variable, hence, any change in make, type and model for partly-mechanised, mechanised and automatic welding results in non-conformance. It is very difficult to achieve same conditions with a new contractor. "

Subsea Engineering,Materials,Bolts,Should Xylan coating be specified for bolts in subsea applications?,"No, because it interferes with the CP system and acts as an isolator, making CP protection (of the bolts) ineffective. Also, the coating can get damaged when torqing up. It is more common in onshore structures/pipelines. It does make bolt tightening easier (less friction). Hence, sometimes preferred by contractors. If specified by a client, it could be a carryover from onshore specifications."
Subsea Engineering,Materials,Bolts,Are bolts for subsea applications specified with a galvanised finish?,"For nuts and bolts subject to CP, a thick coating of zinc is not required and can cause problems with threads, therefore thinner coatings are specified for corrosion resistance during transit and storage only. "
Subsea Engineering,Valves,Certification,For what valve components are Level 3.2 inspection certs typically required?,"The Fabulous 5 elements, i.e., the Body, Bonnet, Stem, Ball and Seats."
Subsea Engineering,Valves,Qualification,Is it acceptable to accept PR2 testing from previous valves/projects? ,"Generally, you can accept PR2 testing from previous projects, one size up or one size down is OK. Otherwise, perform project-specific PR2 testing (e.g., HHTP project 2024). A guide price (based on Wood 2022 in-house data) for PR2 valve testing is c.$50,000. HHTP cost in 2024 was $28,187. Typical schedule impact is 4-6 weeks."
Subsea Engineering,Valves,Seats,Why would you specify a DPE (double piston effect) seat on one side of a valve?,"SPE/DPE good for blind flange side. DPE offers more protection against leak downstream but is more costly. SPE (single piston effect allows pressure above the design pressure, in the cavity to be relived to the downstream pipe. DPE does not allow this, pressure builds up in cavity. Usually there is a separate means to relieve this pressure from the cavity."
Subsea Engineering,Materials,Qualification,Can you perform welding qualification if you don't have test rings/materials for the project?,"It's undesirable, but it may be acceptable if the contractor can find suitable materials with similar chemistry to the project materials, e.g., pipe, flanges, etc."
Project Management,PMBOK,Change Management,"You are managing a project, and a key stakeholder requests a change to the scope. What should you do first?",Evaluate the change request and its impact on the project before submitting it for formal approval.

Management & Leadership,Strategy,Definitions,What is Parkinson's Law?,Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. More time or more people doesn't always mean faster/better results.
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,Why should leadership be involved in operations?,Being very involved in operations allows senior leaders to identify and remove bottlenecks as soon as they arise. This creates a fast moving culture that allows for quicker delivery/shipping/iteration.
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,Why should leadership routinely talk to all staff levels?,"Leadership must spend time talking to doers, not VPs/Directors. This gives leadership a better sense of how the company is doing and what are the needs at any given moment."
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,Why are excessive meetings in an organisation bad?,"Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Get rid of all large meetings, unless you're certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short."
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,What is wrong with a chain of command culture?,"Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the ""chain of command"". Managers should not enforce a chain of command culture. A major source of issues is poor communication between departments. The way to solve this is to allow the free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between departments, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen."
Subsea Engineering,Landfalls,Direct Pipe,What coatings are commonly specified for direct-pipe casings on landfall crossings?,"External coating (4.5 mm 3LPE) provided to reduce friction during pipe pushing and mitigate corrosion (mainly for drain on pipeline CP if interaction occurs). Internal coating should be considered to also mitigate corrosion (and CP drain) if contact occurs between the casing and the pipeline. Usually the CWC is low within the casing and the anodes will be flush with the CWC. Hence, contact can occur between anode and casing. Testing can be peformed to test for contact but it may not be 100% accurate/reliable. "
Pipeline Engineering,Fishing Interaction,Design Checks,What are the main pipeline checks for fishing interaction?,Impact on the external surface and consequent possible denting of steel flowline structure. Hooking with consequent vertical lifting and possible overstressing of the flowline. Pullover with consequent lateral displacement and possible overstressing of the flowline. Forces may need to be combined with buckling and other forces if the frequency of occurence of fishing is high. This must be checked on a project by project basis.
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Definitions,What is Goodhart's law?,"Goodhart's law is an adage often stated as, ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"". It is named after British economist Charles Goodhart."
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,Why should frequent meetings be avoided?,"Frequent meetings disrupt workflow. Use meetings for urgent issues, critical discussions and to verify progress (where necessary). Use emails and chat (where possible) to resolve minor issues and for routine updates."
Data Science,Data Mining,Rule of Thumb,What is a rule-of-thumb missing value % cut-off for retention of a feature in a dataset? ,"If 50% or more values are missing for the feature, it is suggested to delete the feature."
Data Science,Data Mining,Rule of Thumb,Above what degree (%) of 'missingness' is imputation not advisable?,"Above 30%, imputation is not advisable. It should never be performed when 50% or more values for the feature are missing."
Data Science,Data Mining,Feature Engineering,What is a negative of one-hot encoding for categorical features?,"It can lead to high dimensionality, possibly longer training times and/or underperformance. For implementation, consider map function in Python or SciKit learn's one-hot encoder function."
Data Science,Data Mining,Data Preparation,Name three sampling strategies?,"1) Systematic, 2) Random, and 3) Stratified."
Data Science,Data Mining,Modelling,What is 'bias' in modelling?,"Bias is error from eroneous or overly simplfied assumptions, e.g., modelling a complex real-life problem with a simple model. High bias can be characterised by underfitting. "
Data Science,Data Mining,Modelling,What is 'variance' in modelling?,Error due to sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training dataset. High variance could be characterised as overfitting.
