Subsea Engineering,Materials,Bolts,Should Xylan coating be specified for bolts in subsea applications?,"No, because it interferes with the CP system and acts as an isolator, making CP protection (of the bolts) ineffective. Also, the coating can get damaged when torqing up. It is more common in onshore structures/pipelines. It does make bolt tightening easier (less friction). Hence, sometimes preferred by contractors. If specified by a client, it could be a carryover from onshore specifications."
Subsea Engineering,Materials,Bolts,Are bolts for subsea applications specified with a galvanised finish?,"For nuts and bolts subject to CP, a thick coating of zinc is not required and can cause problems with threads, therefore thinner coatings are specified for corrosion resistance during transit and storage only.

Otherwise, perform project-specific PR2 testing (e.g., HHTP project 2024). A guide price (based on Wood 2022 in-house data) for PR2 valve testing is c.$50,000. HHTP cost in 2024 was $28,187. Typical schedule impact is 4-6 weeks."
Subsea Engineering,Valves,Seats,Why would you specify a DPE (double piston effect) seat on one side of a valve?,"SPE/DPE good for blind flange side. DPE offers more protection against leak downstream but is more costly. SPE (single piston effect allows pressure above the design pressure, in the cavity to be relived to the downstream pipe. DPE does not allow this, pressure builds up in cavity. Usually there is a separate means to relieve this pressure from the cavity."
Subsea Engineering,Materials,Qualification,Can you perform welding qualification if you don't have test rings/materials for the project?,"It's undesirable, but it may be acceptable if the contractor can find suitable materials with similar chemistry to the project materials, e.g., pipe, flanges, etc."

Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,Why are excessive meetings in an organisation bad?,"Elon Musk - Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Get rid of all large meetings, unless you're certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short."
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,What is wrong with a chain of command culture?,"Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the ""chain of command"". Managers should not enforce a chain of command culture. A major source of issues is poor communication between departments. The way to solve this is to allow the free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between departments, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen."
Subsea Engineering,Landfalls,Direct Pipe,What coatings are commonly specified for direct-pipe casings on landfall crossings?,"External coating (4.5 mm 3LPE) provided to reduce friction during pipe pushing and mitigate corrosion (mainly for drain on pipeline CP if interaction occurs). Internal coating should be considered to also mitigate corrosion (and CP drain) if contact occurs between the casing and the pipeline. Usually the CWC is low within the casing and the anodes will be flush with the CWC. Hence, contact can occur between anode and casing. Testing can be peformed to test for contact but it may not be 100% accurate/reliable. "
Pipeline Engineering,Fishing Interaction,Design Checks,What are the main pipeline checks for fishing interaction?,Impact on the external surface and consequent possible denting of steel flowline structure. Hooking with consequent vertical lifting and possible overstressing of the flowline. Pullover with consequent lateral displacement and possible overstressing of the flowline. Forces may need to be combined with buckling and other forces if the frequency of occurence of fishing is high. This must be checked on a project by project basis.
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Definitions,What is Goodhart's law?,"Goodhart's law is an adage often stated as, ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"". It is named after British economist Charles Goodhart."
Management & Leadership,Strategy,Industry Insights,Why should frequent meetings be avoided?,"Frequent meetings disrupt workflow.

Interviews,Management,Delivery at Pace,Can you tell us about a time when you had to manage multiple competing priorities to a high quality?,"In a previous role as Senior Project Managere I was tasked with leading two major projects simultaneously: the detailed design of a flowline system in deepwater for a new major client and delivery management for the construction of a new offshore shallow water pipeline for an old (but smaller) client. PRIORITIZATION: I worked with stakeholders to understand (and plot out) the business impact and deadlines for both projects. This helped me allocate resources appropriately. For instance, the deepwater design project had a series of hard delivery dates (linked to LDs), while the shallow water delivery management project was more fluid due to delays with the avaiability of the main EPC contractor. DELEGATION: I leveraged my team’s strengths by assigning specific tasks to individuals based on their expertise. COMMUNICATION: I set up clear milestones for both projects and maintained open communication with stakeholders. Weekly checkins ensured transparency and allowed me to address any blockers quickly.

Structural Engineering,Renovation,External Wall Insulation,What are the main considerations when retro fitting insulation to an old solid external wall?,"The solid wall must be able to dry from both sides for full reliabilty. Especially in areas of high and exposed rainfall. In dry areas, with low rainfall, or certain conditions (all walls have good exposure to wind to dry them out), you might get away with blocking the inner face with an insulated barrier (e.g., PIR insulation). However, in an area with high rainfall, the most reliable and extensible method (there are others if the wall itself is not damp, see www.greenspec.co.uk) is to leave a small cavity (say 50mm) and use a vapour permeable insulation (e.g., mineral fibre nsulation). You will need more space compared to PIR to achieve the same U-value requirements."

Pipeline Engineering,Walking,Mitigation Devices,Name a pipeline walking device suited to shallow water and rocky/hard ground conditions?,"One technique for anchoring walking lines in shallow water is the adoption of PCMs (post clamped Mattresses). The resence of hardground/rock, means you are unable to adopt a skirted foundation type and the preference is usually to rely on a device that simply works on a friction basis. However, dependning on anchor forces, the number of device required could be significant."
Pipeline Engineering,Walking,Mitigation Devices,Name a pipeline walking device suited to deepwater and clay/sand ground conditions?,"Post-installed skirted anchor, typical max anchor force 1,000-1,500kN."
Subsea Engineering,Drilling,Jackup Rigs,What is a typical max water depth for the use of a jack-up rig?,125m
Data Science,LLMs,Transformers,"In data science, what is a 'transformer' and the principle of 'attention'?","The Transformer is an encoder-decoder architecture that uses multi-head self-attention. The encoder inputs a sequence of words, for example, a sentence in Spanish, and generates a vector representation. The decoder inputs the vector and outputs a difference sequence, for example, the translation of the sentence in English. Self-attention is a way of measuring the strength of relationships between words in a sentence. For example, in ""The cat is white and it likes to sleep"", self-attention allows to associate ""it"" with ""cat"". This process is enabled by a query matrix that represents ""it"" and a key and a value matrices that represent the rest of the words. These 3 matrices are learned during the training process. Each head is a different self-attention procedure that creates different representations of the query, key, and value matrices. It lets the transformer consider several previous words simultaneously, and makes it robust at understanding the text."
Pipeline Engineering,Certification,CA,What is the role of the certifying authority (CA) on a pipeline project?,"The Certifying Authority (CA) is an independent body who is appointed by Company and is responsible for certifying the project upon completion. The CA will verify that the project has been designed, fabricated, constructed and operated in accordance with the project's primary codes and standards.

And inspection coverage for pre-commissioning and commissioning works is also required. The TPI role is not always required, depends on client preferences. The TPI will have a more permanent presence than the CA. For efficiency, the CA and TPI roles are often combined and awarded to the same entity."
Data Science,Modelling,Regression,What is Linear Regression?,"Linear Regression is a mathematical relationship between an independent and dependent variable. The relationship is a direct proportion, relation making it the most simple relationship between the variables. Y = mX + c where Y = dependent variables, X = independent variables, m and c are constants."
